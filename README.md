# Hi, I'm Rudy Espinoza!

Currrently I'm taking a Full Stack Developer Course to gain some fluency regarding coding and undestards in certaing detail what is going on in terms of technology.

This is the link of my webpage: https://raechiq.github.io/RudyEspPortfolio/

# Project Portfolio

In this repository you will find a summary of the big project I worked so far as part of the course. There you will find:

- The main page:
  This includes a description of myself, a little bit about my motivations regarding this course and the link to each of the projects. I tried to make it as interactive as possible, however, I'm still learning, hopefully this wil get improved in the future.
- Projects:
  - PACMAC Exercise
  - Eyes Exercise
  - REAL TIME BUS TRACKER

# Lessons Learned

Things I thing I can highlight regarding this module:

- Interacting with the DOM
- Styling and using external repositories as a baseline
- Interacting and Managing Data with Javascript, JSON and DOM

# Improvement Roadmap

When I was trying to put all together as one webpage I encounter so many challenges and knowledge gaps, the main pain point I think are the following:

- I need to keep practising and understanding CSS and HTML.
- understanding the best practices when I'm using Bootstrap
- Managing UX

The improvements I want to work on this are:

Pacman - Add a Ghost running await form Pacman and being able to eat it.
Eyes - I want to add a timer if nobody clicks the eyes will start blinking or doing funny faces
Live Bus Tracking - I want to add levels to each bus and algo something to change routes.
