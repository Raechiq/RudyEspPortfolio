# EYES

This project main objective was to build 2 eyes that follow the mouse position. I include also a head shape to make it more human like and include features to change the size of the eyes with a click, this makes the project a little more funny and engaging.

# Improvements

The planned Improvements for this project are:

- Include a fuction to make the eyes blinking every X time when the person does not click or move the mouse.
